# Description

This is an implementation of a Self Checkout System that projects and applies core functionalities of a cash register system, utilizing concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, and state-pattern, all displayed by a GUI. This project was completed under my Object Oriented Programmings course with the skeleton code provided by my professor, Jesse Hartloff.
